## Discrete Fourier Transform with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it)*

A project, made in Eclipse (Mars), for experimenting with the Discrete Fourier transform (and its inverse), starting from two grayscale images: a circle and the *sin* function. Example images are provided in the `images` folder.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 3.0) and JavaFX (version 2 or superior) and create a `User Library` named `opencv` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.

A guide for getting started with OpenCV and Java is available at [http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html](http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
